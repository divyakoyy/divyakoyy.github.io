Teaching Assistant at Duke University

As an undergraduate TA, I taught a weekly discussion section, tutored students in small groups, held office hours, graded assignments, and answered questions online for the following courses:

* Introduction to Computer Science (Fall 2016)
* Data Structures and Algorithms (Spring 2017 and Spring 2018)
* Introduction to Computational Genomics (Fall 2017)
