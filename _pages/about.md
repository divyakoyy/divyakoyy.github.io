I'm a second year Computational Biology PhD Student at the [Tri-Institutional PhD program](https://compbio.triiprograms.org/) (Cornell University/Weill Cornell + MSK Cancer Center + Rockefeller University). I am in the [Quaid Morris Lab](https://www.morrislab.ai/) where I develop machine learning methods to better understand cancer evolution and gene regulation. I work on methods that use gradient based learning of discrete objects to learn the history of metastatis in patients' cancer evolution trees. I like developing easy to use software tools, which is incredibly important in a field that brings together scientists from various backgrounds.

I graduated cum laude from [Duke University](https://duke.edu/) with a B.S. in Computer Science, where I worked on interesting problems in [NLP](https://jair.org/index.php/jair/article/view/12665), was a teaching assistant for numerous computer science courses, and was captain of a [dance team](https://dukedhamaka.weebly.com/). After graduating I spent three years at Apple developing [health software](https://developer.apple.com/health-fitness/).


<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
